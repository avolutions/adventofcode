# Advent of Code 2024
My solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/) written in TypeScript.

> **Notice**: Following the [AoC about page](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about), solutions in this repository only published after the daily leaderboard is already full. Also no personal puzzle inputs are commited.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   > npm install
3. Build:
   > npm run build

# Usage
The solutions to the puzzles for each day can be selected and executed separately.

## Input
Each solution requires an individual puzzle input. Copy **your** puzzle input to `input.txt` before running a solution.

## Select from list
To get a list of all available puzzle solutions, execute the following command:
> npm run advent

This will show you a list from which you can select a day using the arrow keys:

Where `<day>` needs to be a valid and existing day, see [Solutions](#solutions)
